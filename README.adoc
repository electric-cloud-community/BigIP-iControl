== Plugin configurations

Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
across some or all of the plugin procedures. They
reduce repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets for end users, and
securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
is given a unique name that is entered in designated
parameters on procedures that use them.
